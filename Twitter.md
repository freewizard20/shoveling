1. The UI is more important than you think. The small difference will make a hugeful amount of difference and most times the cheapest/effective way of attracting new people(users).
2. Software Engineering is somewhat a little bit not my aptitude as all small-and-big logics are equally important(especially the small logics result up in huge time consuming bugs). I forget those specifics for effective memory usage and normally it works, but not in SW as there is not a single line of free lunch... This is a huge drawback/bottleneck for my progress and thought process. Or if else, if the design is perfect and if I only need to focus on specific programming, it would be a lot easier. Context switching for me also reduces my productivity very much.
3. A cryptocurrency coin, which acts like a share but not an legal entity. It shall officially be a voting point for organizations and will recieve rewards as for all the work done. Why not have this for an individual? The coins are for your investments. So I shall might sell a freewizard coin, which I will reimburse them for $1mm each when I meet a net worth on the capitalism society. - Just an Idea. Not really planning to do so. But I think this might be better than giving huge amounts of debts even before entering their first professions. And why not? looks like a fun investment for me though, investing will become more easy on many aspects. Good for cryptocurrency prices too, if only the network processing speed dosen't meet it's limits. Legal and investor protections? That's also necessary. But with the blockchain, everything will become more natural and there will be less fraud upon us(paradoxical thing is that blockchain industry is the most fradulent now).
4. Now, who wants some freewizard coins? ;)
5. Not see the coins, see the meaning and possibilities of blockchain. It removes fraud and it is the "agreement(consortium) machine" to decide the "never changing trust" as it is the "trust machine". Use it well and you will earn the most wanted in history. It has the potential to prosper the local economy. Many communities will have their ..? . And decentralization will bring back value to the human how important and rare a person is.
6. You can issue your coins as a matter of value, but also they can just be a medium of collections. Just as if you decided to donate to UNICEF. I was also related with that {{whatever}}. To say, the real intrinsic value of BITCOIN is the fact that you own a bitcoin. Too simple enough? You've got the historical coin. What else can you imagine? Imaginations will all become true.
* An exchange of value
* Commemorative coin
* A new kind of revenue sharing methodology(especially when it binds with smart contracts)
* A new kind of agreement-making voting right tokens
* Investment-return smart contract memorandum
* Collectables
* A new type of organization
* All of above is decentralized.
7. Beware of Centralization and value the slow but right. Slow but right might lose competition, but it never goes wrong.
