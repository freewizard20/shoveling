1. The purpose of these writings are mostly just for my english writing experiences.
2. The UI is more important than you think. The small difference will make a hugeful amount of difference and most times the cheapest/effective way of attracting new people(users).
3. Software Engineering is somewhat a little bit not my aptitude as all small-and-big logics are equally important(especially the small logics result up in huge time consuming bugs). I forget those specifics for effective memory usage and normally it works, but not in SW as there is not a single line of free lunch... This is a huge drawback/bottleneck for my progress and thought process. Or if else, if the design is perfect and if I only need to focus on specific programming, it would be a lot easier. Context switching for me also reduces my productivity very much.
4. A cryptocurrency coin, which acts like a share but not an legal entity. It shall officially be a voting point for organizations and will recieve rewards as for all the work done. Why not have this for an individual? The coins are for your investments. So I shall might sell a freewizard coin, which I will reimburse them for $1mm each when I meet a net worth on the capitalism society. - Just an Idea. Not really planning to do so. But I think this might be better than giving huge amounts of debts even before entering their first professions. And why not? looks like a fun investment for me though, investing will become more easy on many aspects. Good for cryptocurrency prices too, if only the network processing speed dosen't meet it's limits. Legal and investor protections? That's also necessary. But with the blockchain, everything will become more natural and there will be less fraud upon us(paradoxical thing is that blockchain industry is the most fradulent now).
5. Now, who wants some freewizard coins? ;)
6. Not see the coins, see the meaning and possibilities of blockchain. It removes fraud and it is the "agreement(consortium) machine" to decide the "never changing trust" as it is the "trust machine". Use it well and you will earn the most wanted in history. It has the potential to prosper the local economy. Many communities will have their ..? . And decentralization will bring back value to the human how important and rare a person is.
7. You can issue your coins as a matter of value, but also they can just be a medium of collections. Just as if you decided to donate to UNICEF. I was also related with that {{whatever}}. To say, the real intrinsic value of BITCOIN is the fact that you own a bitcoin. Too simple enough? You've got the historical coin. What else can you imagine? Imaginations will all become true.
* An exchange of value(Local or national, EVEN SUITABLE FOR YOUR FRIENDS.)
* Commemorative coin
* A new kind of revenue sharing methodology(especially when it binds with smart contracts)
* A new kind of agreement-making voting right tokens
* Investment-return smart contract memorandum
* Collectables
* A new type of organization
* All of above is decentralized.
8. Beware of Centralization and value the slow but right. Slow but right might lose competition, but it never goes wrong.
9. May not able to be say yet, but it gives back "The ultimate power" back to the (whatever describes you but not communism - I really don't even care about what it is because I`M NOT INTERESTED, SORRY). and that is where the world is going to.
10. it would be better if Ethereum sidechains develop faster. As some visionaries worry, the most people who hold same interests with ethereum just speculate and don't contribute to the ecosystem. These are similar to public infrastructures. As I am not related with the project, I have not much to say, but wish them best luck, but there is one thing worth an aware which is, that the core development is getting way too little investments compared to the gigantic all-kinds-of ecosystems flying around. Everyone are shifting the heavy work on the small budget. Of course, the free Open source direction is definately right. Simply there needs to be a design of flow on the ecosystem and it would be better. I already know that it has been negatively decided as it might end as plutocracy decision influences, and rather deciding protocols come from a nonprofit organization.
11. The only reason I'm talking about this is because Ethereum is in it's golden tipping point. The core throughoutput is stagnating the imaginations of many applications. And if the development becomes too slow, the ecosystem will starve and nothing on earth has infinite opportunities.
12. The one thing lacking here is the user interface. Improving that, there will be many applications available.
13. Blockchain is way more than you think.
14. It dosen't mean you invest money into them.
15. One thing different about cryptocurrency is that it shared it's growing values decentralized. Even though there were gigantic earners from those coins, at least everyone had the chance of getting a share of it and that's decentralization.
16. For other technologies, the chances don't come to a normal person. It's up for the {{whoevers}} possible.
17. crypto can change that. But not only crypto changes that. The flow is going to that direction.
18. Youtube is also decentralization. SNSs contributed freeing many dictated worlds. there is freedom of speech. Of course there are many side effects that arose after it. It wasn't "MAGIC". There were/are side effects like "fake news", "hate", more to say..
19. Blockchain answers to that problem. Take it seriously. Not the coins if you don't need them. I'm talking about the tecknology and meaning behind it.
20. Blockchain is not Fraud. it is the trust machine.
21. Want to know how? If you can't think it out, data will guide your way.
22. The new intellect is called Deep-learning. It will assist you with possibillities you never even have dreamed of.
23. Treat it nice with love and kindness then it will learn to give you back the world.
24. Act in fear and ignorance and there is no way of stopping it. It will develop anyways with strangled minds.
25. Go the easy way and there will be no harm.
26. CENTRALIZATION AND DECENTRAILZATION : what is it? Can they co-exist? What is the natural natures of it? Is there a "right" one to pursue? Answer needs many bright minds but the time is too short as I might write on when I have the time to do so.
27. Thinking from a top-down view, and thinking from the critical use cases and continuous meaning of it reveals many aspects of the actions that are taken..
28. By watching at the paradigms of blockchain consensus algorithms, we may reflect on what we should do on meeting agreements(consensuses). The completely decentralized model is clearly inefficient, but definately right. It consumes very much resources. But as the computers evolve there came plenty of resources so we use browser engines in desktop applications, we may be able to do complete democracy with extra technology, time, and income.
29. But beforehand as we observe sidechains and local consortiums also, those hierarchical decentralized(but somewhat ends as a centralized "MASTER" conclusion) decisions must also be made to abstract many issues and see what is debatable as a whole.
30. It is all concerned for a happier society. Peoples(I cannot say any more of people or community as some call it communism-for their ... -) So, whatever, the humans are not happy with all this whatever - cutting - edge - lives. What's wrong? Humans are losing human. They need to go back to the point where humans are more precious and thankful, more important. And Technology and decentralization shall solve your hard-mind. It somewhat will. We are in an era of quite a mount of change, This is as big as the ..., so, whatever to say, It will be important it goes peacefully, and organized not like the past world have went through. No, Don't do halocaust Don't kill each other, ... it will be a little unorganized, sometimes messy but, anyways the world will change to a much peaceful and happy place, believe me. Somewhere that a human will live with a full mind, where humans shall be respected by their hearts, not something disposable. Capitalism has no thing to do with this if you are feeling something about it. Capitalism is truly the most efficient and wise way of progressing humanity. Money flows to the most effective area to seek growth. The Intellect gains their profit for being wise. The profit seeking portfolio never intented to be so, but it ends in developing the best industries in return.
31. Of course, It everyone just decides to sit down and do only investing, who's going to do the hard work? Well this part I decide not to mention.
32. The world flows gently but without stopping. See where all it goes and you shall be rewarded with everything and a peace of mind.
33. The physicist is the one nearest to God.
34. And you think he's a stupid persion? Because he had silly like assumptions? Nothing would progress if at least of it. And what do you think who contributed the better?
35. Imagining is not a silly thing. Imagining makes progress. No, seriously.
