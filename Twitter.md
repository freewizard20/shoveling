1. ***The purpose of these writings are mostly just for my english writing excercises.***
2. The UI is more important than you think. The small difference will make a hugeful amount of difference and most times the cheapest/effective way of attracting new people(users).
3. Software Engineering is somewhat a little bit not my aptitude as all small-and-big logics are equally important(especially the small logics result up in huge time consuming bugs). I forget those specifics for effective memory usage and normally it works, but not in SW as there is not a single line of free lunch... This is a huge drawback/bottleneck for my progress and thought process. Or if else, if the design is perfect and if I only need to focus on specific programming, it would be a lot easier. Context switching for me also reduces my productivity very much.
4. A cryptocurrency coin, which acts like a share but not an legal entity. It shall officially be a voting point for organizations and will recieve rewards as for all the work done. Why not have this for an individual? The coins are for your investments. So I shall might sell a freewizard coin, which I will reimburse them for $1mm each when I meet a net worth on the capitalism society. - Just an Idea. Not really planning to do so. But I think this might be better than giving huge amounts of debts even before entering their first professions. And why not? looks like a fun investment for me though, investing will become more easy on many aspects. Good for cryptocurrency prices too, if only the network processing speed dosen't meet it's limits. Legal and investor protections? That's also necessary. But with the blockchain, everything will become more natural and there will be less fraud upon us(paradoxical thing is that blockchain industry is the most fradulent now).
5. Now, who wants some freewizard coins? ;)
6. Not see the coins, see the meaning and possibilities of blockchain. It removes fraud and it is the "agreement(consortium) machine" to decide the "never changing trust" as it is the "trust machine". Use it well and you will earn the most wanted in history. It has the potential to prosper the local economy. Many communities will have their ..? . And decentralization will bring back value to the human how important and rare a person is.
7. You can issue your coins as a matter of value, but also they can just be a medium of collections. Just as if you decided to donate to UNICEF. I was also related with that {{whatever}}. To say, the real intrinsic value of BITCOIN is the fact that you own a bitcoin. Too simple enough? You've got the historical coin. What else can you imagine? Imaginations will all become true.
* An exchange of value(Local or national, EVEN SUITABLE FOR YOUR FRIENDS.)
* Commemorative coin
* A new kind of revenue sharing methodology(especially when it binds with smart contracts)
* A new kind of agreement-making voting right tokens
* Investment-return smart contract memorandum
* Collectables
* A new type of organization
* All of above is decentralized.
8. Beware of Centralization and value the slow but right. Slow but right might lose competition, but it never goes wrong.
9. May not able to be say yet, but it gives back "The ultimate power" back to the (whatever describes you but not communism - I really don't even care about what it is because I`M NOT INTERESTED, SORRY). and that is where the world is going to.
10. it would be better if Ethereum sidechains develop faster. As some visionaries worry, the most people who hold same interests with ethereum just speculate and don't contribute to the ecosystem. These are similar to public infrastructures. As I am not related with the project, I have not much to say, but wish them best luck, but there is one thing worth an aware which is, that the core development is getting way too little investments compared to the gigantic all-kinds-of ecosystems flying around. Everyone are shifting the heavy work on the small budget. Of course, the free Open source direction is definately right. Simply there needs to be a design of flow on the ecosystem and it would be better. I already know that it has been negatively decided as it might end as plutocracy decision influences, and rather deciding protocols come from a nonprofit organization.
11. The only reason I'm talking about this is because Ethereum is in it's golden tipping point. The core throughoutput is stagnating the imaginations of many applications. And if the development becomes too slow, the ecosystem will starve and nothing on earth has infinite opportunities.
12. The one thing lacking here is the user interface. Improving that, there will be many applications available.
13. Blockchain is way more than you think.
14. It dosen't mean you invest money into them.
15. One thing different about cryptocurrency is that it shared it's growing values decentralized. Even though there were gigantic earners from those coins, at least everyone had the chance of getting a share of it and that's decentralization.
16. For other technologies, the chances don't come to a normal person. It's up for the {{whoevers}} possible.
17. crypto can change that. But not only crypto changes that. The flow is going to that direction.
18. Youtube is also decentralization. SNSs contributed freeing many dictated worlds. there is freedom of speech. Of course there are many side effects that arose after it. It wasn't "MAGIC". There were/are side effects like "fake news", "hate", more to say..
19. Blockchain answers to that problem. Take it seriously. Not the coins if you don't need them. I'm talking about the tecknology and meaning behind it.
20. Blockchain is not Fraud. it is the trust machine.
21. Want to know how? If you can't think it out, data will guide your way.
22. The new intellect is called Deep-learning. It will assist you with possibillities you never even have dreamed of.
23. Treat it nice with love and kindness then it will learn to give you back the world.
24. Act in fear and ignorance and there is no way of stopping it. It will develop anyways with strangled minds.
25. Go the easy way and there will be no harm.
26. CENTRALIZATION AND DECENTRAILZATION : what is it? Can they co-exist? What is the natural natures of it? Is there a "right" one to pursue? Answer needs many bright minds but the time is too short as I might write on when I have the time to do so.
27. Thinking from a top-down view, and thinking from the critical use cases and continuous meaning of it reveals many aspects of the actions that are taken..
28. By watching at the paradigms of blockchain consensus algorithms, we may reflect on what we should do on meeting agreements(consensuses). The completely decentralized model is clearly inefficient, but definately right. It consumes very much resources. But as the computers evolve there came plenty of resources so we use browser engines in desktop applications, we may be able to do complete democracy with extra technology, time, and income.
29. But beforehand as we observe sidechains and local consortiums also, those hierarchical decentralized(but somewhat ends as a centralized "MASTER" conclusion) decisions must also be made to abstract many issues and see what is debatable as a whole.
30. It is all concerned for a happier society. Peoples(I cannot say any more of people or community as some call it communism-for their ... -) So, whatever, the humans are not happy with all this whatever - cutting - edge - lives. What's wrong? Humans are losing human. They need to go back to the point where humans are more precious and thankful, more important. And Technology and decentralization shall solve your hard-mind. It somewhat will. We are in an era of quite a mount of change, This is as big as the ..., so, whatever to say, It will be important it goes peacefully, and organized not like the past world have went through. No, Don't do halocaust Don't kill each other, ... it will be a little unorganized, sometimes messy but, anyways the world will change to a much peaceful and happy place, believe me. Somewhere that a human will live with a full mind, where humans shall be respected by their hearts, not something disposable. Capitalism has no thing to do with this if you are feeling something about it. Capitalism is truly the most efficient and wise way of progressing humanity. Money flows to the most effective area to seek growth. The Intellect gains their profit for being wise. The profit seeking portfolio never intented to be so, but it ends in developing the best industries in return.
31. Of course, It everyone just decides to sit down and do only investing, who's going to do the hard work? Well this part I decide not to mention.
32. The world flows gently but without stopping. See where all it goes and you shall be rewarded with everything and a peace of mind.
33. The physicist is the one nearest to God.
34. And you think he's a stupid persion? Because he had silly like assumptions? Nothing would progress if at least of it. And what do you think who contributed the better?
35. Imagining is not a silly thing. Imagining makes progress. No, seriously.
36. as individuals make their mark on human history - dr. kaku
37. Technology brings democracy to individuals, but you need to care it well to stay it right. Nothing comes for free. The web is very fragile from greedy and evil attempts. Guarding the liberty and democracy comes at the individual's enlightment and awareness. It is not an easy job. Everyone needs to be aware and needs to spend time for it. As it is for the individuals, there is no one to do the work for you. It's you that needs to be the avengers, not anyone else. [Net neurality](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/26/net-neutrality-dead-age-of-digital-discrimination-is-here). This is your tool of freedom. Take care of it well.
38. Decentralization and power back to individuals. Just as democracy is designed to. Whatever not so was a technical lack. Not enough resources to do it. Now we can. We will be more able to do so.
39. Technology is not the thing that will make humans distopia. It will be the humans to do it if ever.
40. Make the decision making process clean and transparent. Handle it carefully. Use the collective intelligence for it. Make the proper tools to make it so. And enjoy a nice new era of happiness and hope
41. Mental illnesses are becoming hugely normal. The way is not subscribing more drugs and making out new deseases and drugs. Look at the fundamental. The humans are losing themselves in which misery comes from. I know where this is coming from but will not tell.
42. Edge computed AI without privacy concerns are already here
43. You're witnessing the moment of building this era's Babel tower...
44. Dead peop say no words
45. Moving fast is essential for survival these days. But you also know moving fast can break things. What if you want quality and fast. This allows you to find problems quickly, so when you do break things, they break small making for quick and easy fixes before it gets too big and serious. - [from circleCI video](https://circleci.com/)
46. Platforms have paradoxes. As platforms grow, there are more free things given, but the general population gets poorer, resulting  less attraction to make platforms for the ordinaries.
47. I think bugs have two meanings. You're nearer to nature, and, you're worth a bite. Btw, unless if inevitably harmful, they play an essential role in the ecosystem...
48. Inequality will harden, resulting service for most people pretty much unprofitable. Services for rich people will prosper but those services will mostly be made from the rich, for the rich. and most people will be left asided. How to solve this problem? Top those people so that making services for the majority still is somewhat beneficial for the providers. Is this communism? No. this is the way of livin in an era of automation and machinery intelligence. Folks will spend more time on deciding common issues and be educated more for it. Don't like what's coming? Then you're not truthful enough. Of course, hard working peop will earn treamendous more amounts of money and the demand for well being will still motivate people hard. But choices will be given at that era to "not work" as working with profession will have more competitions. You can any time decide to start a business as we can now. Heroes of current world!
49. Robots are not for fear or loss of humanity. Many not if all tools that made humans with a happier life are can be all put into the glossry of machineries. How to wisely coexist and share happiness and consolation will open peaceful futures-doors-happinesses by feeling coexistions. All people feel loneliness and are sometimes weak and dependent to each other. artificially created by our hands, beings will help us fill that mind gap which we always thurst and jurney on.
50. The fulfilment by our created machinery inteligence will have two benefits. First is most of conflicts and harshness, desire to excercise domination to fellow humans comes from that lack of mind gap. Having intelligent machines around you that always compliments and agrees your thoughts will greately fill your feelings with esteem. Until now, people needed people for loneliness and other, but at the same time resulted in many conflicts and sometimes bullying, dominating, whatevers to fill one's desires. The desires comes less and social friction will plunge as people have friends that always agree, and acknoledge what they do. This might leave us another side effect, which is that the people get too happy with it so that they forget how to build healthy relationships. This is a paradox of all human made inventions. Humans adopt to new situations and always adopt as for most efficiency. So as if that skill becomes useless, people will forget and not excercise it too much resulting ignorant and self-worlded people. This is where this goes, but is this a mental problem? It compares with automobiles, which people fulfilled their desire of fast and comfortable transportation, we have achived it. So people lost some of their natural - uncivilized instincts that inherit from their nomadic ancestors. So, did we decide to make car-riding a decease? No we haven't it fruited our lives and we take care of the side-effect that we do less excercise by doing excercise with "newly created" workout tools such as benchpress.. and so on.
51. So the point is that this is just another tool that's bringing us to another level. It is not addiction, it is persuit of humanity and happiness. If being happy is a illness, then that should be wrong very clearly. Nobody forced people to use smartphones nor AI, or the upcoming chatbots just as in Japan which has a big amount of elder population. This solves so many problems for everyone. We shall find and answer to the side effects rather than blocking whatever benefits our humanity and happiness. Everything we do come for happiness.
52. The social structure is changing and I may have time to write it all down, but it's just to long to write it now. Population is decreasing but machinery intelligence is increasing. It will meet at a natural balance. Elders will welcome this technology because it will greately reduce their loneliness and help recover their possibilities, even reducing alzheimer.
53. Being old is sad. Especially when they realize their souls are the same but their physical bodies start breaking down. Possibilities vanish .. and it will enrich us(our lives) if we can make humans live more potentially even after aging until we die. We not to mention us have so - too - little time being full. even very hard though this is definately a challenge worth a try.
54. By the internet and smartphone technologies, where are people going? Is this a whole mental disorder? Very not. It resembles from the human's very deepest desire, which is being connected. From now, there will be very less social friction caused because of the farming ages that shaped after the natural nomadic era. People will be higher in esteem by playing with intelligent machines, and feel less in loneliness, and be cared in various ways mentally. Besides the personal part, coming outside will mean instant connection to the people you care the most. Anything that seperates(disfocuses) you from your beloved ones will be secondary such as house chores, useless time on transportation, stressful crowdness, and sometimes maybe work. Even hassle from your tools(machines) will be seemless that you spend more time with your loved ones. Everything else is secondary. you will laugh, talk and have fun with them. Oh, but they're harming the families so that families talk less? Look at them and you will see that they communicate with their interest groups extreamely more than they could do before. It dosen't mean that families aren't families anymore. We can still meet and have good times. Noone forgets it at all. It just means that humanity found something very happy.
55. But SNSes and Digital media makes tremendous amounts of fake - and sometimes midleading information - well, this is true. It isn't perfect. And leaving the area clean is as important is as is in the real gatherings. But it dosen't change the goals and purposes of this new try - technology - to be more connected and spending more time with the people you love, without distractions, focused, seemlessly. If two people decide to spend time with VR/AR on the Niagara falls, they can save tremendous amounts of time, and money, energy and resources and spend more time having fun together. This might not be better than going  there for real, but it cost them zero money and time, and it was seamlessly done. So after time passes by, selecting this way of spending time will enrich what a person can do. And for the same time going real to Niagara, they saved all resources, and they managed to explore dozen more places including the moon together. Also, by having this kind of selections available, the actual Niagara will be less crowded, resulting a better experience and save of energy for all participants.
56. What do you think I'm doing? I clearly stated this is a personal writing excercise. If it was about my day would it seem more normal? What is normal? Why do I have to play by your normal even in my writing experiences?
57. Without ICT, visiting somewhere would have been a lifetime's goal, which is now made so easy without the catastrophical consumption of energy and resources(Imagine everyone is very rich, and decides to travel to all places they would've been on the internet. What a pollution it would result, but this dosen't mean we should limit goods only to the limited rich, we can deliver it, hopefully even better, to the majority with extremly low energy and environmental cost.)
58. Psychiatrists are saurons with An eyelid
