1. The UI is more important than you think. The small difference will make a hugeful amount of difference and most times the cheapest/effective way of attracting new people(users).
2. Software Engineering is somewhat a little bit not my aptitude as all small-and-big logics are equally important(especially the small logics result up in huge time consuming bugs). I forget those specifics for effective memory usage and normally it works, but not in SW as there is not a single line of free lunch... This is a huge drawback/bottleneck for my progress and thought process. Or if else, if the design is perfect and if I only need to focus on specific programming, it would be a lot easier. Context switching for me also reduces my productivity very much.
